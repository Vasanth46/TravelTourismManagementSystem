# TravelTourismManagementSystem
The travel and tourism management system is a Java-based application that allows users to search and book hotels and travel packages. The system has two main components: hotel booking and package booking.

The hotel booking component allows users to search for available hotels based on their desired location, check-in and check-out dates, and number of guests. The user can then select a hotel and make a booking, which is stored in a database.

The package booking component allows users to search for travel packages, which may include flights, hotels, and activities. Users can select a package and customize it by adding or removing components. Once the user has selected a package, they can make a booking, which is also stored in the database.

The system includes a user registration and authentication system, which allows users to create an account and log in to access their bookings and account information.

The system also includes an admin panel, which allows administrators to manage hotels, packages, and user bookings. Administrators can add new hotels and packages, view and manage bookings, and generate reports on system activity.
